# Quinn's website

A SPA for Quinn and his photograpy.

Refer to this [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/GPuZBwWqqAww197yF2EcFu/Quinn's-website?node-id=0%3A1) for guide.

Refer to this [Style guide](./src/assets/STYLEGUIDE.md) markdown for more details regarding CSS.

### TODO:
- [ ] Fix head tag in html to reflect Quinn's website
- [ ] Design skeleton.
- [ ] Make a styleguide.
- [ ] [Infinite Carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/infinite-react-carousel). This library does it for me, just read the docs.
- [ ] Make sure not to use `backdrop-filter` for glass effect, as moz render engine does not support this at the moment.
- [ ] Get more pictures from Quinn (if he wants to put more on this site)
  - Aim for 4 - 6 pictures per event
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for animations:
  - [ ] Adjust nav link highlighting accordingly, as the user scroll through the page.
  - [ ] Not with the carousel, but pictures should fade in as the user scroll.
